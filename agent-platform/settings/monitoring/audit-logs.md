# Audit Logs - Track Account-level User Actions and Events

The Platform's comprehensive **Audit Logs** on the **Settings** console provides full visibility into user actions and system interactions, tracking logins, role changes, and model updates through dynamic time-stamped logs and tracking capabilities.

This empowers admins to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulations, while proactively mitigating risks like data privacy breaches and algorithmic bias. 

Each log entry includes the following to provide actionable insights on account and tool-level activities:

- Event name and category.
- The user who performed the action.
- Date and time of the event.
- Detailed description of the action.


![audit logs metadata](./images/audit-logs-metadata.png "audit logs metadata")



The event metadata provides business users with actionable insights, helping them in efficiently identifying patterns in user activities within their accounts. It also aids in detecting anomalies, spotting unauthorized usage, and enhancing overall account security.

You can specify a **current** or **past period** to view the logs and have complete visibility into the activities and modifications in your account. [Learn more](./audit-logs.md#steps-to-set-time-range-for-audit-logs).

Additionally, you can set **custom filters** based on a specific category, event, or user value to view only the required audit logs. [Learn more](./audit-logs.md#steps-to-add-a-custom-filter).

## Access Audit Logs

To access and view audit logs, follow the steps below:

1. [Navigate](../../administration/overview.md#access-settings-console) to the **Settings** console.
2. Click **Monitoring** > **Audit Logs** on the left navigation menu.

![access audit logs](./images/audit-logs-new-dashboard.png "access audit logs")



## Dashboard Information

The **Audit Logs** dashboard displays the following information to collectively provide a comprehensive overview of activities within your account:

* **Event Name:** Describes the specific event or action that occurred.
* **Category:** Identifies the module or entity affected by the event.
* **User Name:** Specifies the name of the user who performed the action or triggered the event.
* **Date and Time:** Represents when the event occurred.
* **Description:** Provides detailed information about what was done.

## Filter Audit Logs

You can narrow down the information displayed in your account's audit logs by applying custom filters. 

These filters allow you to select specific categories, events, or users and then apply operators like **Is** **Equal To** or **Is Not Equal To** to specify the desired value. 

This customization helps you focus on relevant audit logs, making it easier to track or investigate specific actions or users within your account.

### Steps to Add a Custom Filter

1. [Navigate](../../administration/overview.md#access-settings-console) to the **Settings** Console. 
2. Navigate to **Monitoring** -> **Audit Logs**  on the left menu.
3. Click the **Filter** icon -> **+Add Filter**.
4. In the **Filter By** window, select the required option from the dropdown list for **Select Column**, **Select Operator**, and **Enter Value**.

![select filter](./images/select-filter-from-dropdown.png "select filter")



<Note>When you use "<b>Is Equal To</b>," the audit logs only show entries that match the specified value. Conversely, when you use "<b>Is Not Equal To</b>," the logs display all entries except those that match the specified value.</Note>

For example, applying the filter <b>Event Is Equal To Role Created</b>, as shown below, displays only the logs for the role creation event.


![example filter](./images/example-filter.png "example filter")



To view the logs for all the events except role creation, you must set the filter as follows:


![view all logs](./images/view-all-logs.png "view all logs")



<ol start="6"><li>Click <b>Apply</b>.</li></ol>

All the log entries relevant to the applied filter(s) are displayed, as shown below.

![log entries](./images/log-entries.png "log entries")



To clear the filter settings, click **Clear All**.


![clear all filters](./images/clear-all-filters.png "clear all filters")



The number of filters you have applied is displayed on the **Filter** icon.

### Add Multiple Filters

You can enhance your audit log visibility by adding multiple filters. This capability allows you to specify detailed criteria such as specific categories, events, or users, enabling you to obtain fine-grained results. 

By combining filters, you can precisely focus on and analyze the audit log entries that are most relevant to your requirements.

When adding multiple filters to refine your audit log queries, you can use the **AND** or **OR** operators in multiple filtering steps effectively. 

<Note>Consistency in operator usage is required for each filtering step. This means you need to use either the AND operator or the OR operator throughout all criteria.

Both operators cannot be used together.</Note>


![mutually exclusive operators](./images/operators-mutually-exclusive.png "mutually exclusive operators")



Using the AND operator ensures that all specified conditions must be met for an entry to be included in the results. 

On the other hand, using the OR operator broadens the criteria, allowing entries that meet any of the specified conditions to be included. These operators provide flexibility in tailoring your audit log views.

#### Steps to Add Multiple Filters

1. Follow **Steps 1 to 3** mentioned [here](./audit-logs.md#steps-to-add-a-custom-filter).
2. Select the **AND/OR** operator tab in the **Filter by** window.


    ![filter operators](./images/filter-operators.png "filter operators")



3. Follow **Steps 4 to 5** mentioned [here](./audit-logs.md#steps-to-add-a-custom-filter).

The matched log entries are displayed in the dashboard. 

## Time-based Audit Logs

You can view and monitor audit logs within a specific period with the time selection feature. This capability allows you to focus on audit log entries that occurred within a defined time-frame, and track changes.

Time selection is available for past and current time periods, including the ones listed below:

<Note><b>Last 30 Days</b> is the default selection, which displays logs for the past 30 days from the current date.</Note>

* **All Time**: Displays logs since the time the account was created.
* **Today**: Includes audit logs generated on the current day.
* **Yesterday**:  Includes audit logs generated on the previous day.
* **This Week**: Displays logs for all the days in the current week.
* **This Month**: Displays logs for all the days in the current month.
* **Last Month**: Displays logs for all the days in the previous month.
* **Last 30 Days**: Displays logs for the past 30 days from the current date, if events’ data exists.
* **Last 90 Days**: Displays logs for the past 90 days from the current date.
* **This Year**: Displays logs for all the days in the current year.
* **Last Year**: Displays logs for all the days in the past year.

### Steps to Set Time Range for Audit Logs

1. [Navigate](./audit-logs.md#access-audit-logs) to the **Audit Logs** dashboard.
2. Click the time selection button (displays **Last 30 Days**).

![time selection](./images/click-time-selection.png "time selection")



3. Select the required period on the left panel, or select a specific date, month or year on the calendar widget (the current day is the default selection).
4. Click **Apply**.

![apply changes](./images/apply-changes.png "apply changes")



The audit logs for events that occurred within the selected time period are displayed. 

### Key Considerations and Tips

The time range is automatically selected on the calendar widget once you select the period. Also, the date range is displayed at the bottom of the widget.


![time range display](./images/time-range-display.png "time range display")



You can select a specific month or year from the relevant dropdown list and switch to different months by clicking the **forward/backward** arrows.


![pagination arrows](./images/forward-back-arrows.png "pagination arrows")



To set a specific date as the start date for viewing audit logs, click on the desired date in the widget. 

By default, the current day will be set as the end date. This feature allows you to easily customize the period for which you want to monitor and analyze audit logs.


![custom start date](./images/custom-start-date.png "custom start date")



## Export Audit Logs

The **Export** feature helps prepare and export [account-level audit logs](./audit-logs.md#account-level-audit-logs) into a *.csv* file. The audit logs data for the following columns is downloaded. [Learn more](./audit-logs.md#dashboard-information).

* Date and Time
* Event Name
* Event Category
* Description
* User/App Name
* **IP Address**: The user's network IP address linked to the specific event.

Exporting audit logs offers the following benefits:

* **Detailed Analysis**: CSV format allows you to perform in-depth analysis of log data to identify patterns or anomalies over time, while supporting transparency and accountability.
* **Easy Sharing and Reporting**: CSV files of audit logs are easy to share with other stakeholders or integrate them into reporting tools.
* **Compliance and Record-Keeping**: Having a documented trail in a standardized format is useful for compliance and regulatory audits, ensuring data is readily available when needed.
* **Automation and Integration**: CSVs can be imported into other tools or systems, enabling automation and integration into workflows for continuous monitoring and alerts.

To export audit logs, follow the steps below:

1. [Navigate](./audit-logs.md#access-audit-logs) to the **Audit Logs** dashboard.
2. Click the **Export** icon.

A success message is displayed once the file is downloaded. The file can be found in the configured location in your system.

The downloaded *.CSV* file is automatically named as `<em>Account_Audit_Logs</em>`. The schema of the output file includes the following fields:

* Event Name
* Category
* User Name
* Date & Time
* Description

Audit Logs promotes transparency and accountability in AI operations, helping build trust internally and externally. 

You can confidently scale AI initiatives with event-based user activity logs to manage compliance and ensure responsible use of generative AI.
