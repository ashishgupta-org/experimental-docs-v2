# Deploy, Execute, and Manage Custom Scripts for Tool Automation

The Platform allows admins to import, deploy, and manage custom scripts directly from the **Settings** console. 

A powerful script deployment wizard enables users to easily upload, configure, and deploy custom scripts in isolated containers. By leveraging container isolation, this feature enhances security while providing flexibility in configuring runtime and scaling settings.

Once deployed, these scripts can be run via the [API node’s](../../ai-agents//tools//tool-flows/types-of-nodes/api-node.md) endpoint when building the tool flow. Additionally, the custom scripts can be embedded in the [Function node]() of the tool automation flow and executed when the node flow is run.


On the **Manage Custom Scripts** page, admins can upload a complete script project file, including all definitions and logic, without writing any code in the function node. This allows them to seamlessly port their code or project from a local system into the product and start using it immediately.

You can import a custom script with reusable functions and invoke it from anywhere within the platform using a secure API key at the endpoint. This adds flexibility and offers the following benefits to the tools' automation flow:

* **Task Automation** – Automate repetitive or complex tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention. 

* **Secure API Integration** – Integrate custom scripts into the apps using API endpoints and secure authentication. 

* **Customization** – Implement custom logic or workflows tailored to unique business needs. 

* **Data Processing** – Transform, filter, or validate data in a way that aligns with specific operational requirements. 

* **Error Handling** – Create tailored error-checking and fallback mechanisms beyond standard system behavior. 


You can import a script by uploading the file in one of the supported formats, validating it, configuring runtime settings and system resources, and deploying scripts after reviewing errors. 

The key steps in managing custom scripts are:

1. [Access the script deployment wizard](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#access-script-deployment-wizard).
2. [Import and Configure a script](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#import-and-deploy-a-custom-script) by following these steps:

    * [Step 1: Add general details, upload the script file, and validate the script file for errors](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-1-general-details).
    * [Step 2: Configure the runtime settings for the script to execute successfully.](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-2-runtime-settings).
    * [Step 3: Define resource allocations, including the limitations for hardware, memory, and scaling parameters.](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-3-resource-allocation).
    * [Step 4: Review configuration details and deploy the script.](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-4-review-the-provided-details).

3. [View deployed scripts and their statuses](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#view-deployed-scripts-and-their-statuses).
4. Manage script deployment [overview](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#script-overview), [history](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#deployment-history),  [endpoint](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#endpoint), and [API](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#api-keys).

## Access Script Deployment Wizard

2. Click **+ Import** or **+ Import new**.

![import options](./images/import-options.png "import options")


 
<Note>To complete the configuration, perform each step in order without skipping any.</Note>

### Step 1: General Details

In the **General Details** window, follow these steps:

1. Add a **Script name**.
2. Add a **Description** to define the purpose and capabilities of your custom script.
3. Select **Base Language** (the language in which the script is imported and executed) and **Language Version**. The available options are **JavaScript 20.19.0** and **Python 3.10.15**. More versions will be supported soon.

<Note>The default version is auto-selected when you select the language.</Note>

<ol start="4"><li>To upload the script, click <b>Choose File</b> under <b>Project File</b>, then select the file from your local system.</li></ol>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Important Considerations</p>
<p><ul><li>Supported file formats include `.zip`, `.gz`, and `.tar`.</li>
<li>The max file size is 1 GB. Larger files will result in a validation error.</li>
<li>Click <b>Validate</b> to check the file for errors.</li>

![validate file](./images/validate-file.png "validate file")

</ul>
</p>
</div>

<Info><ul><li>The uploaded file must match the recommended project structure. Click <b>Download sample project</b> to access the <i>.zip</i> folder of the script definitions and follow its structure when uploading your file.</li>
<li>The structure is different for different base languages. Ensure that the correct file structure is followed for the chosen language.</li>
<li>The file naming convention should be followed to avoid any errors.</li>

![file naming convention error](./images/file-naming-convention.png "file naming convention error")

</ul>
</Info>

**Key Considerations for File Validations**:

* Validation checks confirm if the file matches the sample project structure.
* Errors during validation are displayed via messages.
* The list of validations includes the following:
      
    * Adherence to the sample file’s structure and the allowed file format.
    * The main file shouldn’t be empty
    * 1 GB is the limit for the project file upload

If there are no errors, the system proceeds to the next page, **Runtime Settings**. If errors or warnings are present, you must resolve them before proceeding.

**Custom Script Requirements and Guidelines**

To ensure your custom script runs correctly within the platform, follow these guidelines:

**Main Entry Point Required**

Your project must include a `main.py` (for Python) or `main.js` (for JavaScript) at the root directory of the archive file. This file serves as the main entrypoint for the service. Only the functions defined in this file will be exposed for execution via API endpoints or tool integrations.

**Support for Modular Code**

You can organize your code across multiple files for better structure and maintainability. However, keep in mind that only functions in `main.py`/`main.js` will be exposed. Additional files can be used for helper functions or reusable logic, which can be imported into the main file.

**Custom Dependencies (Optional)**

If your code depends on specific packages, include a `requirements.txt` (for Python) or `package.json` (for JavaScript) file at the root directory in your project. These are optional, only include them if your code has external dependencies.

**Use Relative Imports**

When importing between files in your project, make sure to use relative imports. Refer to the provided sample files for examples.


**Use of Environment Variables**

Access environment variables in your scripts as follows:

**Python**: <p>`import os`</p>
             <p>`os.getenv('<key_name>')`</p>

**JavaScript**: 

`process.env.<key_name>`

### Step 2: Runtime Settings

Configure **Runtime variables** (environment variables and execution timeout) to control how your script runs, stores configuration data, and stops executing. The key steps include:

1. Enter the **Key** and the **Value** to declare **environment variables** as key-value pairs that are accessible from your function.
2. (Optional) Click **+ Add** to add additional key-value pairs, and the **Delete** icon to remove.

![add key value](./images/click-add-key.png "add key value")

 

<Note>The following default environment variables are available:
<ul><li><b>UPLOADS_DIR</b>: Read-only access to all files uploaded via the Public APIs. Use this to access data that was submitted to your account.</li>
<li><b>WORKSPACE_DIR</b>: Read-write directory for your function's file operations. Any data your function needs to store or modify will be saved here.</li>
<li>Both directories are accessible only while your container is deployed. Once undeployed, these storage locations will no longer be available.</li></ul></Note>

<ol start="3"><li>Define the <b>Execution timeout</b> in seconds. The allowed range is <b>30 to 600 seconds</b>.</li>
<p><b>Why Script Timeout?</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Prevents resource overuse</b>: Stops long-running or infinite-loop scripts from consuming excessive memory or CPU.</li>
<li><b>Ensures responsiveness</b>: Keeps systems responsive by limiting how long a task can delay other operations.</li>
<li><b>Supports fail-safe mechanisms</b>: If a script fails to complete in time, the timeout can trigger error handling or retries.</li></ul>
<li>Click <b>Next</b>.</li>

![runtime settings](./images/runtime-settings.png "runtime settings")

</ol>

### Step 3: Resource Allocation

On this page, you define scaling parameters (minimum and maximum replicas) and hardware requirements to ensure the script performs optimally under varying loads and to customize the deployment. The key steps include:

1. Set limits for auto-scaling to ensure optimal performance by defining the following **Scaling parameters**:
    * **Min and Max Replicas**: Defines the minimum and maximum number of pods per service that can be created for the service to handle increased load. 

       <Note><ul><li>The allowed range for both parameters is between 1 and 10.</li>
       <li>The default value is 1.</li></ul></Note>

     * **Min replica** should be lower than or equal to the **Max Replica**.
     * **Average Compute Utilization**: A metric based on which scaling of the service happens. Indicates average compute utilization in percentage per pod. The **default value is 75**, and the **allowed range is between 1 and 100**. This metric is disabled when **Min replica** and **Max replica** are the same.
     * Select the required **hardware** for the deployment. The unit is **No. of vCPUs with memory**. The profiles are virtualized for standardization. The available profiles are listed below:

         | <strong>Hardware configuration</strong> | <strong>Actual CPU Core and Memory Available</strong> | <strong>Credits per Hour</strong> |
|:------ |:------ |:------ |
| 2 vCPUs with 8GB memory | 1.5 vCPUs with 6.5GB memory | 0.144 |
| 4 vCPUs with 16GB memory | 3.5 vCPUs with 13.5GB memory | 0.288 |
| 1 vCPU with 2GB memory | 0.7 vCPUs with 1.1GB memory | 0.07698 |
| 2 vCPUs with 4GB memory | 1.5 vCPUs with 2.5GB memory | 0.15396 |
| 4 vCPUs with 8GB memory | 3.5 vCPUs with 6GB memory | 0.30792 |

<ol start="2"><li>Click <b>Next</b>.</li>

![resource allocation](./images/resource-allocation.png "resource allocation")

</ol>


### Step 4: Review the Provided Details

The next step is to review all the configuration details before deploying the script. 

1. Review each section- [General Details](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-1-general-details), [Runtime Settings](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-2-runtime-settings), and  [Resource Allocation](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#step-3-resource-allocation) to ensure all information is accurate. You can return to any section to modify the configured values if needed.
2. Read all the **Terms and Conditions**, and select **Accept** to enable deployment.
3. (Optional) Click **Save as Draft** to save a copy and deploy it later. A success message is displayed, and the label “*Draft*” is displayed for the script. 

![saved as draft](./images/saved-as-draft.png "saved as draft")



4. Click **Deploy**.

![deploy terms](./images/click-deploy-terms.png "deploy terms")



During deployment, the progress status displays “Deploying.”
After the script is successfully deployed, a success message appears and the status changes to “Deployed.”

**Email Notification**

After a custom script is deployed, a confirmation email with the subject line "*Custom script deployed successfully - API Endpoint Available*" is sent to the admin. The following information  for the account is also displayed:

* Credits remaining for the account 

* Total allocation

## View Deployed Scripts and their Statuses

Once a script is deployed or saved as a draft, a table listing all scripts and their statuses becomes available on the **Manage Custom Scripts** page. This allows users to monitor deployment progress and take necessary actions as follows:

**Search Script**

Enter the script name in the **search field** to retrieve a matching entry from the list.

![search script](./images/search-script.png "search script")



**View Summary**

The summary table displays the following fields:

* **Script Name**: The name provided by the user.
* **Status**: The current deployment status of the script.

   ![all statuses](./images/deployment-statuses.png "all statuses")



* **Added by**: The user who added the custom script.
* **Updated on**: The timestamp when an action (deployment, re-deployment, or undeployment) was done on the script.
* **Action**: Perform actions on the script like undeploy, delete, or export. Refer [here](../manage-custom-scripts/custom-scripts.md#actions) for more information.
