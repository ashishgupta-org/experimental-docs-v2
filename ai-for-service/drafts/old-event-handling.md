Intent events let you define AI Agent behavior when the NLP engine encounters issues identifying user intent. This gives you fine-grained control over the user experience during ambiguous or unrecognized inputs.

---

## Intent not Identified

Triggered when the AI Agent cannot understand the user's intent. Choose one of the following responses:

- **Show a standard message** from the standard responses library. [Learn more](/ai-for-service/automation/intelligence/conversation-management/standard-responses)
- **Automatically run a dialog task** — select the task from the dropdown.

## Ambiguous Intents Identified

Triggered when the NLP engine detects multiple intents with similar confidence. By default, the AI Agent presents the list of ambiguous intents to the user for selection.

**This event fires when:**
- Two or more "definite" intents are identified.
- Two or more "possible" intents are identified within the proximity threshold.
- Only low-confidence Knowledge Graph intents are found and no other engine identifies an intent.

You can override the default behavior with a custom Dialog Task that uses `koreUtil.getAmbiguousIntents()` to retrieve ambiguous intents and their confidence scores. [Learn more](/ai-for-service/apis/automation/koreutil-libraries)

### Configure the Event

1. Go to **Conversation Intelligence > Events > Intent Events**.
2. Click **Configure** to enable the event.

   ![configure intent events](/ai-for-service/automation/intelligence/imagesimages/configure-intent-events.png)

   <Note>If not enabled, the list of ambiguous intents is presented to the user.</Note>

3. Select a configuration option:
   - **Present all qualified intents to the end-user for disambiguation** — Default. Shows the standard ambiguous-intent response. [Learn more](/ai-for-service/automation/intelligence/conversation-management/standard-responses)
   - **Automatically run a Dialog Task** — Select a dialog with custom logic for handling ambiguous intents. [Learn more](/ai-for-service/automation/agent-flows#dialog-tasks)

4. Click **Save & Enable**.

   <Note>When ambiguous intents are detected during testing, the Debug Log shows: *Multiple intents are identified — Ambiguous Intents Identified event is initiated.*</Note>

### Interruption Management

When this event is enabled, interruption behavior follows the configured node, dialog, or app-level settings — with one exception: if **Continue the current task and add a new task to the follow-up task list** is selected, the interrupting task is not added to the follow-up list.

## Variable Namespaces

Go to **More Options > Manage Variable Namespaces** at the top of the Events screen to associate variable namespaces with events. This option is visible only when Variable Namespace is enabled for the AI Agent. [Learn more](/ai-for-service/app-settings/managing-namespace)
