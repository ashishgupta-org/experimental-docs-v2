# Export a Workflow

AI for Process offers the ability to export specific workflow versions from your account as self-contained packages for data preservation and sharing. This feature also allows users to transfer workflow configurations without compromising the integrity and security of the workflow setup.

When you export a workflow, AI for Process automatically creates a *.zip* file named after the workflow. For example, if the workflow is named "*Banking Assistant*," the exported file will be "*Banking Assistant.zip*". You can save this folder in the desired location on your local machine.

The exported package can be reimported to create a new workflow or add it as a version to an existing one, ensuring seamless restoration.

The [exported package](#exported-information) preserves the following workflow configurations within JSON files:

* Name and description
* API, Condition, AI, and Script node configurations
* Input/output variables and scanners
* Environment variables
* Sync/Async setup

To maintain security, sensitive information such as **API keys**, **sharing permissions**, **workflow endpoint**, and **audit logs** are excluded from the exported package.

<Note>Users with only <b>Viewer</b> permissions can't export an workflow.</Note>

## Steps to Export a Workflow

## Exported Information

The exported package includes the following JSON files encapsulating the workflow's configuration data:

* ***flow_definition.json***: It includes the workflow's canvas definitions (node definitions) and AI node configurations, including prompts, hyperparameters, and timeout information.
* ***app_definition.json:*** It includes general information about the workflow version and guardrails.
* ***env_variables.json***: It includes the environment variables set for the workflow. [Learn more](../workflows/configure-a-workflow.md).
